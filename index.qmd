What impressed me the most was Emily’s infectious enthusiasm for the cause. It created a wonderful atmosphere of excitement among the students and staff, making the fundraising process not only successful but also enjoyable. Being my first fundraiser, I was initially unsure, but Emily’s Fundraising made it a memorable experience.
